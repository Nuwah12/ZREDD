# CIS-550-Project
In our project, we will explore housing market data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). This data will be hosted on an AWS RDS instance running [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/). \
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) is used as the API backend serving the data, and [React.js](https://react.dev/) is used to render the frontend.
